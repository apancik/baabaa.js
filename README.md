# Baabaa.js

Baabaa.js is a client-side A/B testing library using Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) to track the results.

It is compact (500 bytes when minified), framework agnostic, and simple to understand.

## Installation

### 1. Create custom dimension in Google Analytics

Sign in to your Google Analytics account. On Property that you have edit permissions for go to Admin > Custom Definitions > Create new dimension ([?](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2709829?hl=en)). 

Set

Name:
> "A/B Experiment"

*Can be any name you want*

Scope:
> "User"

*the dimension is then added to the current and future sessions from that visitor to provide consistent view of the variant*

Active:

> "True"

Note down the dimension id displayed on the next screen.

### 2. Include baabaa.js

Include baabaa.js in your code

    <script src="/baabaa.js"></script>

Just after including Google Analytics Universal Analytics code before actually running ````pageview```` event include the experiments definition and run baabaa.js using the following code

    var experiments = {
        experiment1: [
            {
                name: "variant1",
                action: function () {
                    console.log("variant1");
                }
            },
            {
                name: "variant2",
                action: function () {
                    console.log("variant2");
                }
            }
        ]
    };

    baabaa.run(ga, "dimension1", experiments);

Donâ€™t forget to use your dimension id from the step 1 instead of "dimension1" in the example.

Actions are plain javascript functions and so they can be used in tandem with your favourite DOM manipulation library such as jQuery to modify the page. If you wish to run a control variant in your test just use an empty function.

### 3. Run the experiment and see the results

To measure the performance of your tests go to Reporting > Audience > Custom > User defined > and use the dimension created in step 1 to slice the data.

Before drawing conclusions make sure you read about A/B testing and calculate the confidence levels using for example http://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/
